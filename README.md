# Generating boolean (yes/no) questions from any content using T5 text-to-text transformer model and BoolQ dataset


Using this program you can generate **boolean (yes/no)** questions from any content.

## Input

The input to our program will be any **content/paragraph** -

``` Months earlier, Coca-Cola had begun “Project Kansas.” It sounds like a nuclear experiment but it was just a testing project for the new flavor. In individual surveys, they’d found that more than 75% of respondents loved the taste, 15% were indifferent, and 10% had a strong aversion to the taste to the point that they were angry.```

## Ouput

The output will be **boolean (yes/no)** questions generated from the above input. 

**Boolean (yes/no) questions generated from the T5 Model :**

```
1: Does coca cola have a kansas flavor?
2: Is project kansas a new coca cola flavor?
3: Is project kansas the same as coca cola?

```

## Inference code

The **t5_inference.py** file has all the code to run the model on any given paragraph.

## Training the model
The training and validation datasets are present in the **boolq_data** folder.

Install the necessary libraries from **requirements.txt**.

Use any **GPU** machine and run **train.py**

Training this model for 4 epochs (default) took about 5-6 hrs on **DGX Machine**.

Note that since the dataset is small I barely used the validation set.

Also not all the questions generated by model are of high quality because of small training dataset it is trained on.
